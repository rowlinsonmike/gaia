# Roadmap

GAIA was concieved entirely within a workday as part of a hackathon. So there will be some **rough edges**. 

Some current objectives and their projected timeline - 

- well architected production deployment (short term)
- Report generation (short term)
- Advanced terraform configurations for projects (short term)
- Event driven projects that kick off jobs based on commits (mid term)
